# Getting Started

## What is **Crypt Sweeper**?

**Crypt Sweeper** is a rules-light, laughs-heavy, sword & planet tabletop roleplaying game. It is designed as a game best-suited to _one-shots_ or short, side campaigns. This text will assume you have some familiarity with tabletop roleplaying. In **Crypt Sweeper** one player takes on the role of the **Keeper** and the other players take on the role of a crew of **Sweepers**.

Sweepers are responsible for embodying a character, playing to their personality and belongings. Sweepers are also responsible for all dice rolling. The Sweeper’s job? Make the government richer. Grab all you can, if it’s shiny, it’s worth it. If it’s _really_ shiny, it’s probably worth more than your life.

The Keeper is responsible for presenting situations to the Sweepers, playing as all non-player characters and monsters the table encounters, and has final say on rulings. In other games, this role may be called the Gamemaster.

## What Do You Need?

To play Crypt Sweepers you will need the following:

* One to five other people to play with.
* A number of Character Sheets equal the total number of participants (minus one) distributed to all players, either printed or online.
* Pencils and erasers.
* **Dice!** Specifically one each of 4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided, and 20-sided dice.

A set of polyhedral dice like this should be readily available at your local game or comic book store. It is _strongly suggested_ that your table has more than one of each of these, and _ideal_ that everybody has their own.

### Dice Notation

This text will use dice notation. For example, a 20-sided die will be referred to as a d20. Two 20-sided dice are referred to as 2d20. And, if you are supposed to modify a die roll, it will be made clear with arithmetical symbols following the number and type of dice. Rolling two 20-sided dice and subtracting "2" from the result would be represented as: 2d20-2.

## Tips & Thoughts

* Combat is deadly. Player characters, by design, have low **HP**, are not difficult to hit, and usually have armor that does not adequately protect them from the horrors of the Crypt. It’s all good though, **re-rolling a new character takes 5 minutes**!
* When the Keeper asks an open ended question, it’s almost always an invitation to collaborate. Don’t automatically look for the answer on your sheet; use your imagination!
* Player characters are largely defined by what they carry. There are no “classes” or “jobs”. Consider this while you manage your inventory as a party.
* Start the session just as you’re breaking through the planet’s atmosphere. _You’re about to delve into the crypt._
* This is an intentionally comedic game. Encourage and work with zany ideas. Say “YES!” when players use their inventory and Talents creatively. Likewise, players should not be surprised if goofing off or betraying Zzardon’s trust results in a sudden, hilarious, over-the-top death.

# The World

## Interstellar Republic of Suns

The **Interstellar Republic of Suns** (or, the IRS) is an all-expansive, intergalactic, multi-planar tyranny. If a being is sentient, it is subservient to the IRS -- even some rocks have been forced into labor.

Their overwhelming rule has lasted eons. It is unwavering. Ironclad. Your great, great, great, great, great grandparents were beholden to the IRS. And, so are you.

The leader of the IRS is **His Luminance,** **Zzardon Sol the Dazzling**. He has been in power for 12 569 years. Zzardon is a sacred king, governing from divine right, revered as **God**. Of religious living beings, 97.84% worship Zzardon. It is estimated that the other 2.26% worship Ruple the Slug Queen.

## The Conquest

For thousands of years His Luminance has commanded his most ruthless army, the **Spear of Sol**, in an over-the-top conquest. The aim is simple: chart the uncharted and conquer it.

If a planet does not bow to the IRS, they rain hellfire. If a planet has no obvious value to the Empire? Decimated. If a planet speaks ill of Zzardon’s ornate attire? Erased from existence.


## The Graveyard

The Graveyard is vast. Light years of cratered, war torn planetary bodies. It is seemingly endless. The way to track its expansion, of course, is to follow the Spear of Sol. Everything behind the Spear, that is The Graveyard.

In Crypt Sweepers, players will spend all of their time in The Graveyard. It is where they _work_. It is where they descend upon ruined planets, delve through ancient dungeons, and struggle to survive. 

Sweepers chase after the Spear’s conquest _thousands of years_ behind. On these ruined planets, there is seldom unprotected wealth. **The more impressive the treasure, the more likely something vile, twisted, intelligent, and _powerful _is protecting it.**


## The Job

To earn their rations, players must “sweep” through the mess that Zzardon has made in search of **treasure**. Gold, weapons, precious gems, rare metals, antiques, mystical artifacts, endemic life -- you name it. _The IRS wants it all._

Like most lowly work, it’s a structured loop that must be followed:

1. Find a radar ping: a promise of treasure.
2. Land on the planet, wreckage, asteroid, or _thing_.
3. Go sweeping. Grab, grab, grab. Don’t die.
4. Follow your Cable, get back to safety.
5. Dump your payload at the Loot Bay.
6. Collect Sweep Stubs and hope you can eat tonight.

In generic terms: player characters are insignificant government employees (called “Sweepers”) who are staffed with exploring long-forgotten dungeons on ruined planets. Their specific task is to loot everything of value without dying and return it to their spaceship vault. In doing this, they get a government currency called “Sweep Stubs” which they can spend on upgraded gear and unique equipment.

# Character Creation

You are a Sweeper. The lowest of the low. Did you get here as a prisoner of war? Perhaps you signed up through your own enthusiasm, hoping to plunder your way to an office job? Well, in either case: you’re _still_ a sweeper.

**To create a Sweeper, follow these steps in order:**

1. Roll **3d6** four times and, as you roll, record the results, in order onto your sheet into these four boxes:
    * MIGHT
    * AGILITY
    * CRAFT
    * ZEAL
2. Roll once on each of the **Starting Gear**, **Personality**,and **Talent** tables on pages 5-13, recording the results onto your character sheet.
3. Each Sweeper also starts with the following in their inventory:
    * 1 Glowstick (1 slot)
4. Roll **1d6+MIGHT** to determine your HP and record it on your character sheet. If this results in a negative number, your character has tragically died in transit. Roll a new one, but roll **4d6** when determining their MIGHT.
5. Name your Sweeper, think of what they may look like and write some buzzwords in “Description”, and **you’re done!**


## Abilities

|   Ability   |                    Use                    |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
|  **MIGHT**  |      Hardiness, athleticism, lifting      |
| **AGILITY** |       Defense, balance, acting quick      |
|  **CRAFT**  | Cunning, knowledge, technical application |
|   **ZEAL**  |       Courage, zest, Sol-bound luck       |


**Roll 3d6** and use the table on the right to determine your ability score, from **-3 to +3.** The sum is not used once the character is created, only the table value. Repeat this four times, for each ability.

_For example, Marisa rolls 3d6 for MIGHT, getting an 11. She records 0 on her character sheet. AGILITY is an 8, MIND is a natural 18, and ZEAL is another 11. This gives her **0, -1, +3, and 0**; pretty good!_


| Sum | Score |
|:---:|:-----:|
|  1-4   |    -3   |
|  5-6   |   -2    |
|  7-8   |   -1    |
|  9-12   |    ±0   |
|  13-14   |   +1    |
|  14-16   |   +2    |
|   17-20  |    +3   |
|   20+  |    +4   |

# Gameplay

Even with somewhat simplified rules, Crypt Sweepers follows a classic tabletop roleplaying structure that everyone at the table should understand. 

First, the Keeper will describe the scene. Once the Keeper describes anything, they will invite players to act, often asking “_what do you do_”? Sweepers are free to narrate what they do, and are encouraged to think outside of the box.

The Conversation stops when the Keeper thinks something in the fiction is risky or interesting enough to become a **Test**. This loop continues freely without tracking until the Sweepers initiate combat or leave the area.

## Scanning

Work in progress.

## Sweeping

Dungeoneering. Looting ship graveyards. A vacated asteroid mine. When Sweeping, you will encounter many crypts in The Graveyard. Although these sites vary in aesthetic and type, there are common traits between them that Sweepers are aware of.

### Noise

When actions the Sweepers take would reasonably make a loud noise, the Keeper should prompt the source of the noise to make a test (**DR 12 ZEAL**). If they fail, the Keeper should introduce an interesting consequence. This could be alerting nearby enemies, triggering a trap, or something entirely different.

### Doors

When doors are not locked, jammed, or otherwise obstructed they can just be opened. When they are jammed, a test (**DR 12 MIGHT**) is required. When they are locked, a key can open the door. Otherwise, Sweepers can try to lockpick it with appropriate tools (**DR 12 CRAFT**) or break the lock (**DR 16 MIGHT**).

### Treasure

Gold, gems, rings, amulets, chalices, ornate swords, tapestries, relics – **Zzardon wants it all.**

Treasure is essential to Crypt Sweepers. For the Sweeper, it is your livelihood. If you return empty handed, you don’t eat. For the Keeper, it is what creates all tension and struggle for your players. Remember this.

Treasure in Crypt Sweepers is different from other games. Gold pieces and artifacts alike have no value to anyone or anything the Sweeper will interact with. **The only value treasure has is to be synthesized into Sweep Stubs.**

Sweep Stubs are the only items of value for the Sweeper. With them, they can purchase items at the Sweep Shop to enhance their ability to Sweep. There are rumors that a master Sweeper can even Stub his way out of Sweeping – but nobody has really seen it happen.

### Loot Cards

Loot is represented in **Crypt Sweeper** with Loot cards. When a room has Loot, the keeper will draw from a randomized Loot deck to determine what it is. Loot cards share this format:

_[Picture of loot card.]_

**_Picture:_** A pictorial representation of the loot. 

**_Stub Value:_** How many Sweep Stubs the loot is worth when converted.

**_Slots:_** How many inventory slots the loot takes up when carried.

**_Additional Text:_** Used only by weapons, Sweep Gear, or special artifacts. Describes relevant information (weapon damage, gear effect, etc.).

## Inventory

There is one thing crucial to your career as a Sweeper: _how much treasure you can carry_. Therefore, integral to this game is the **inventory**.

In Crypt Sweepers, a character’s inventory is represented by **slots**. Slots are represented by a grid on the character sheet. Unless otherwise specified, items take up one slot.

Characters have 10 inventory slots.

Most treasure Sweepers obtain will take up 1 slot in their inventory. 100 coins is equal to one slot.

## Tests

A **Test** is always a **d20** roll plus one Ability. The Keeper will ask the Sweepers to make tests when it is appropriate. The difficulty rating (or **DR**) will be dependent on the difficulty of the task. When it is obvious to the characters, The Keeper may share the DR before an attempt is made. **Meeting or exceeding the DR results in success.** To determine DR, use this chart:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Difficulty
   </td>
   <td>Target <strong>DR</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Trivial
   </td>
   <td>6
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Easy
   </td>
   <td>8
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Average
   </td>
   <td>12
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Hard
   </td>
   <td>16
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Barely Doable
   </td>
   <td>18
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Example

_The Keeper describes a room with a locked door. Marisa wants to get through it, but doesn’t have applicable tools. She asks if she can break the lock. The Keeper agrees that this is feasible, but hard and asks her to make a **MIGHT Test** Marisa rolls 1d20+ **MIGHT** and gets a 12, describing how she slams her Axe on the handle. The Keeper narrates the failure and may present a consequence._

## Advantage & Disadvantage

A Sweeper with **Advantage** will roll **2d20** when they make a test or attack. They use the _higher_ of the two rolled numbers, which greatly _increases_ chances of success in most cases.

A Sweeper with **Disadvantage** will roll **2d20** when they make a test or attack. They use the _lower_ of the two rolled numbers, which greatly _reduces_ chances of success in most cases.

Several **Talents** give Advantage in specific scenarios. Otherwise, Advantage is gained through The Conversation. If you have a Past, Attitude, Quirk, Sweeper Tool, or previously canonized ability or disposition that _the table agrees_ would give your Sweeper a clear advantage, you get advantage.

In combat, players can use their action to help another Sweeper, giving them Advantage on their next attack or test.

When The Keeper decides that you have a Past, Attitude, Quirk, Sweeper Tool, or previously canonized ability or disposition that _the Keeper agrees_would give your Sweeper a clear disadvantage, you get disadvantage.

# Combat

Combat in Crypt Sweepers is deadly. Sweepers are incompetent, by design. Fighting round-per-round until either you or the enemy dies should be a last resort. The table should try to apply outside of the box thinking to combat whenever possible, and use their ingenuity to come up with **decisive victories** or **alternate solutions**.


## Structure

1. A Sweeper rolls for initiative. 
2. Each individual in the combat chooses what to do. They are able to do one of each of the following:
    * Move
    * Take an action
    * Talk in character as much as they would like to, within reason.
3. When all of the players or enemies have taken turns, the opposing force takes its turns.
4. Return to **1.** and repeat until there are corpses on the ground or participants flee.

## Initiative

Initiative is taken at the beginning of every combat round. An initiative roll is a single **d6** roll, done by any player. On a 1-3, the enemies go first. On a 4-6, the players go first.

The Sweepers decide who of them acts first. The Keeper decides which of the enemies they are controlling acts first.

## Moving

While in combat, Sweepers can move freely as long as they move between adjacent relative ranges (described below). There is no penalty for moving in or out of enemy threat ranges. In most cases there is no way to move especially fast, especially in relation to how fast you are being chased. Without a novel idea or solution, you will not be able to outrun enemies that choose to chase you.

## Range

Range is separated into three abstracted zones: **Beside**, **Close**, and **Far**. These zones exist only as a relation between two or more things. We choose not to prescribe specific measurements or mathematics to these zones and expect the table to reach consensus about what fits their fiction and fun.

When two things are **Beside**, they are within “arm’s reach”.  Melee combat, driving a car, and most touch interactions happen from Beside range.

When two things are **Close**, they could be Beside each other within several strides or a burst of movement. Generally one “dungeon room” is a close environment. Moving to Beside range, throwing objects, or specific powers can happen from Close range.

When two things are **Far**, they are too distant to reach with a burst of movement and will take significant effort to approach. If there is a cavernous room, an outdoor environment, or a shooting range, things will be far apart. Moving to Close range, firing a sniper rifle, or sending a smoke signal can happen from Far range.


## Actions

All actions that occur in combat fall under four terms: **attack**, **help**, **grab**, and **use**.

When **attacking**, the Sweeper rolls **1d20** and adds the relevant stat to their attack based on their weapon (see Weapons table in Equipment Chapter). The target number is based on the enemy and is information that only the Keeper sees. Most mundane enemies have a **hit DR** of 12.

When **helping**, the Sweeper describes how their actions will benefit one of their allies. If the table reaches a consensus that it would indeed be helpful, then the next test or attack relevant to that help will gain Advantage.

When **grabbing**, Sweepers do their damned job! Grabbing is picking up loot and stowing it into your PACK. When you grab, roll **1d6+ZEAL**. On a 6+, the Sweeper gains one treasure from the Loot deck. On a result ≤3, the Sweeper is put at risk and invites a consequence (they are attacked or the enemy gains some advantage). On a 4 or 5, nothing happens and their action is used.

Lastly, a character may **use** an object or ability on their turn as their action. Some Talents require you to use your action; if they do, they explicitly say so. Using any Sweep Tech or items in your inventory for any non-attacking purpose counts as a **use** action.

## Getting Attacked

When a Sweeper is attacked, the Keeper does not roll “to hit”. Instead, the Sweeper must roll **d20+AGILITY** to dodge or defend against the attack. The **DR** will be based on the enemy’s stat block and must be announced to the player as they are being attacked (_“Marisa, roll to dodge the attack. You need to meet or exceed 18; this is a deadly monster"_).

## Fumbles and Crits

Any **natural 1** rolled on an attack is a fumble. Any **natural 20** rolled on an attack is a critical hit.

When a Sweeper **fumbles an attack roll**, the Keeper should introduce an interesting consequence, timer, or threat. The situation gets worse.

When a Sweeper **critically hits an enemy with an attack roll**, their damage is doubled. Alternatively, the Sweeper can bargain with the Keeper to gain a more creative advantage if they forgo the extra damage.

When a Sweeper **fumbles a defense roll**, the enemy deals double damage on their attack.

When the Sweeper **critically hits a defense roll**, they counterattack and automatically deal their damage to the foe they are defending against.

## Armor Soak

When a character fails to dodge an attack and is hit, they negate damage equal to their Armor soak, as denoted on the Armor table in the Equipment Chapter.

## Reaching 0 HP

When a Sweeper reaches **0 HP**, they **_die_**. When a Sweeper dies, the player controlling them should quickly roll up a new character. The Keeper will introduce the new character immediately into the fiction, collaborating with the table to think of an amusing reason.

## The “Other” Action

I lied. There is a fifth action you can take in Combat: the **other**. Do you want to swing from the Chandelier? Trip the enemy with your crowbar? Throw oil on the ground to turn it into a slippery mess? You can.

In some of these cases, the Keeper will ask for a test. In others, you simply do what you set out to do. How do you know when you will be tested? Reach a consensus, trust the conversation, and don’t betray the fiction or the fun.

# Character Advancement

The Sweepers you play will not become heroes. They will not gain shiny abilities. Let’s not kid, they probably won’t even survive.

The toil of Sweeping – the literal worst job in the entire universe – is crushing. Sweepers do not gain impressive strength, magic powers, or extra attacks.

However, there is nothing to worry about; you can become better through **promotion** and **consumerism**! Let’s talk about shopping first. Welcome to the…

## Promotions

The Zzardonian dream is alive, 12 569 years and counting. Thank goodness each and every Sweeper has an opportunity to strive towards the ultimate prize: climbing the corporate ladder. Freshly rolled Sweepers start at the bottom rung. With enough accomplished Sweeps, they can get **promotions**.

Sweepers rise through four tiers of promotion: **Novice Sweeper**, **Senior Sweeper**, **Team Leader**, and **Crypt Warden**. 

The Sweepers gain perks when promoted. _Suggested_ advancement  milestones and perks are represented on the table below:

  </tr>
</table>

**Health Benefits:** Heal to full health and heal diseases when you finish a Sweep.

**Intern:** Gain an Intern follower. An intern is a Novice Sweeper with the following stats:

```
Intern: 1 HP, autoshiv, morale 5, ±0 to all abilities 
```

The intern follows your commands and trusts your ability as a Sweeper. They are, however, unwilling to put themselves in obvious danger. When forced into a fight or flight situation, the Intern must make a Morale roll. On a success, they fight back. Otherwise, they flee.

**Retirement:** Ah, time to settle down with a desk position. No more dungeons for you. Roll up a new Sweeper, this one has escaped the toil and torment of dungeoneering. 

Alternatively, play another game system keeping the same character. *Support other developers, buy indie products!*

**Crypt Sweepers is a rules-light, laughs-heavy dungeon exploration game about working the worst job in the universe and trying to survive together.**
